# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **K-Means Clustering algorithm** to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase behavior. The dataset used is the **Mall Customer Dataset**.  

By applying clustering, we can identify distinct groups of customers to help businesses improve **marketing strategies, customer engagement, and personalized recommendations.**
